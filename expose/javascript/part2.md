1. 3, because when i = 3, the for loop is exited
2. 150, because 300 / 2 = 150
3. 150, because 150 * 100 / 100 = 150
4. The code returns [ 50, 100, 150 ], because those are the correct values calculated in the for loop that were appended to discounted, and that list is being returned
5. It would give an error, as i is defined in the for block, and print is outside that block
6. It would give an error, as discountedPrice is defined in the for block, and print is outside that block
7. 150, same as 3.
8. Same 4.
9. Same as 5.
10. 3, as that is the number assigned to length
11. Same as 4.
12. 
    1.  student.name
    2.  student["Grad Year"]
    3.  student.greeting()
    4.  student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    5.  student.courseload[0]
13. 
    1. 32, as the 2 is changed into a string and then concatenated
    2. 1, as 3 is changed into an int, and 3 - 2 = 1
    3. 3, as adding a null value which is interpreted as nothing with an integer, is the same as doing 3 + 0 
    4. 3null, as null is changed into a string and then concatenated
    5. 4, as true is interpreted 1 and 3 + 1 = 4
    6. 0, as false and null is interpreted as 0, 0 + 0 = 0
    7. 3undefined, as undefined is changed to a string and added to the string 3
    8. NaN, as - changed 3 into a number, and undefined is changed into NaN, and anything subtracted by NaN becomes NaN
 14. 
     1. true, as '2' is changed into a number and then comapred, and 2 is greater than 1
     2. false, as the unicode of 2 is greater than the unicode of 1
     3. true, as '2' is changed into an int, and 2 is equal to 2
     4. false, as '2' is a different data type from 2
     5. false, as true is converted to a 1, and 1 doesnt equal 2
     6. true, as boolean(2) returns true, and true === true
  15. == simply compares values, whereas === compares values AND types, so it is a stricter comparison
  16. see file
  17. [2, 4, 6], as for each number in the array, it is passed into the function doSomething, which doubles it, and then that number is pushed into the array being returned by modifyArray
  18. 1 4 3 2 (vertically)
